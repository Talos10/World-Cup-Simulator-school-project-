//Purpose of the program: To simulate what a World Cup tournament is like,
//starting from the Round of 16 with 16 teams, where the user enters his/her
//favorite team and then the program simulates the tournament multiple times
//until the team of the user has won the tournament or until the maximum tournament
//iterations of 20 has been reached.
